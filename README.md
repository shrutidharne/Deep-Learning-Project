#Image Classification using CNN
I developed an image classification system by designing and implementing it using the VGG19 model, which was pretrained on ImageNet. I built a web application using Flask that allows users to upload images and receive predictions. For image preprocessing, I utilized TensorFlow Keras preprocessing utilities to ensure the images were properly prepared for model prediction. The model was efficiently saved and loaded to facilitate seamless deployment.
